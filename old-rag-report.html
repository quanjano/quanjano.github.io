        I worked in Maryland over the summer and I chose to drive, which meant when the program was over, I had a 13-hour drive 
        back home to Alabama. The route from Maryland to Birmingham, Alabama almost perfectly follows the 
        Appalachian Mountains which meant there were lots of interesting hikes along the way. To make the drive a bit 
        more interesting, I made a couple stops on the way back. My first stop was about 2 1/2 hours into the drive, at Old Rag 
        Mountain in Shenandoah National Park. The route was a little over 9 miles, 3.8 miles on the trek up to the summit, and 5.3 miles 
        on the way down the long side. The first 2 miles or so was standard uphill hiking but the last stretch up to the summit was the 
        gnarliest rock scramble I have done since climbing Katahdin in Maine. It was a lot of fun, it's like a big playground made of 
        boulders. At the summit, I made a danger doodle (timber rattlesnake) friend and took in the view. I jogged
        the 5.3 miles down the backside of the mountain on a fire road so I'd have time to make the 4 1/2 hour drive to my next stop.

        After driving across basically the entirety of Virginia &mdash; which is bigger than you’d think, as I had learned the hard way on 
        my thru-hike of the AT &mdash; I came to the Elk Garden Trailhead in the Mount Rogers National Recreation Area. From there, a quick
         couple miles uphill on the AT through the Lewis Fork Wilderness got me to the trail junction to Mount Rogers, the Virginia state 
        highpoint. I already went up Mount Rogers during my thru-hike, and while it is a neat and beautiful wooded summit, I just 
        didn’t have time this trip. So I continued another 3 or so miles to get into the heart of the Grayson Highlands. As the evening 
        came, the clouds and the golden light made quite the dramatic scene, and the greenery was very vivid and verdant. I enjoyed the 
        rest of the evening sitting on the rocks and taking in the view. I set up camp on top of Pine Mountain, where I had first seen the 
        wild ponies that inhabit the highlands on my thru-hike. Unfortunately, the sunset was covered by clouds, and those same clouds 
        shrouded the stars and soaked my tarp in condensation. But it was all worth it for that sunrise the next morning, when I woke up 
        above the clouds. I packed up and took the VA Horse Trail for the last stretch back, which I would not recommend since wherever 
        there are horses, there is also horse shit. I got back to the trailhead and started off towards home. These were
        two awesome hikes I look forward to doing again.
