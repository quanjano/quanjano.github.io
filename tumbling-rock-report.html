  <h4>tumbling rock cave in north alabama. saltpeter in the caves were used to make gunpowder in the civil war.
    about 2 or 3 miles into the cave is the king's shower, 
    technically the tallest waterfall in alabama, at about 400ft.
     5 miles in is a 200ft mountain of mud and stone called mount olympus.
    it is a slippery climb and very steep. at the top is the cave register, caked in mud, stowed in a pvc tube. 
my name is in there somewhere.</h4>
