    This was a great hike in the Jefferson National Forest, right on the border between Virginia and West Virginia. 
    It very much reminded me of the Pinhoti Trail back home in Alabama. I started at dry gap and hiked about 10 miles along the Tuscarora Trail
    up to the Pinancle shelter. There were some great rocky outcroppings with some nice views (as seen below), especially at the golden hour.
    Best of all, there was nobody else out there and I had the whole ridgeline to myself. Do keep in mind there is no water until you get past the shelter. I personally enjoyed this hike
    more than most of the AT through Shenandoah NP and I'd like to explore more of the Tuscarora Trail.
